<h2>My data journalism pitches:</h2>
<h4><strong>1. Science research and innovation in Canada: How are we doing?</strong></h4>
<p>Using data from Statistics Canada, I would like to look at how the Harper government, a government that is <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/science/canada-losing-ground-in-global-science-race-report/article12052990/">notoriously anti-science</a>, has affected spending in science and tech over the last few years. I think I can do this by going through the following reports:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.stic-csti.ca/eic/site/stic-csti.nsf/eng/h_00058.html">2012 report</a></p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.stic-csti.ca/eic/site/stic-csti.nsf/eng/h_00038.html">2010 report</a> </p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.stic-csti.ca/eic/site/stic-csti.nsf/eng/h_00011.html">2008 report</a> </p>

<h4><strong>2. Evolution of bilingualism in Canada: Le francais disparait-il vraiment (is French really disappearing)?</strong></h4>


<p>Using data from Statistics Canada again, I would like to Map the evolution of bilingualism in Canada. <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11795-eng.htm">This report</a> was released recently on the subject, but the data is really hard to understand, so I think it would be cool to find a way to make it more accessible in a visual way.</p>

<h1>Just how bad is the Southern Alberta flood?</h1>
<h3 style="text-align:left;" style="width:700px;">The 2013 Southern Alberta flood has a projected cost of over one billion dollars. That's more than the total cost of Albertan floods since 1970.</h3>

<p style="width:700px;" style="text-align:justify;">As relief efforts continue, it is becoming increasingly clear that the flood that took place in Alberta in June was like no other. It is, by far, <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2013/06/26/albertas-worst-flood-in-history-risks-knocking-canadian-economy-off-course/">the worst flood in the province's history</a>. The Albertan government estimates that the total cost of the flood will <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/story/2013/06/27/business-alberta-flood.html">top one billion dollars</a>&mdash;35 percent more than the total cost of the floods that occured in the province between 1970 and 2010. Worse yet, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/history-suggests-it-may-take-time-for-ottawa-to-foot-flood-cleanup-bill/article12848684/">a report from the Globe and Mail</a> suggests that it will be many years before the province receives any of the relief money Ottawa sets aside for such disasters.</p>
